So we designed the Volt. The Volt is not only equipped with a 4mm integrated positioning board but Kailh hot-swappable sockets, Bluetooth 3.0, full-key RGB LEDs, and USB Type-C as well as Percent Studio’s new design language. We've also experienced changes in suppliers, concepts, production, and quality control process. We believe that customers participating in the group buy will have felt the difference. Together, with great optimism in our product, we proudly introduce you to our latest piece, Volt."
