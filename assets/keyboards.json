The color of the PVD is silver.  \n- All the default and aluminum plates are all the skeleton versions. The FR4 plates and PVD brass plates are all the regular version. \n- There are two versions of PCBs. The hot-swappable version has a fixed layout (7u spacebar) and has pre-soldered switch LEDs. The solder version supports various layouts for MX and ALPS switches. Both versions will have VIA support. \n- The default plate supports the ANSI MX layout only. ISO is not supported on the default plate as many people (especially me) hate compatible Enter holes. The PCB does support ISO and I will share the plate files later.\n \nPlease note: \n- Take your time and make the decisions carefully. Please don't email me to change options after the order is placed. I will ignore emails regarding such requests. \n- Please don't request combinations that cannot be chosen from this page (e.g., different colors on the weight and plate, second extra PCB, etc.) \n- I will charge a 2% transaction/handling fee for any order cancellations. \n- The shipping address can be revised before the boards are shipped. However, it is your responsibility to contact me if you moved. I may or may not be able to remind you to update the shipping address.\n- This is a group buy. You will not receive the product any time soon after you placed the order. The lead time of delivering it to you is expected to be 5 months."
